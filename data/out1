"58","SSRS limit length of text but keep full words","<p>In my table I have essentially 2 columns (many more but there is an obvious left side and right side). One of the fields, FIELD1, on the left side comes from a LookupSet() and each ID can have two items from FIELD1. Using a join(lookupset(), vbcrlf) I am able to get both values for the ID and put it into one cell in the table. This works but with the vbcrlf, the row height is increased. This causes a problem because there is data on the right side which cannot have additional space between it.</p>

<p>I did a split(join(lookupset())).getValue(0) for the first row and then the row below it for value 1. With some iif statements to check errors etc, this works.</p>

<p>One problem I solved is that the values for FIELD1 can be longer than the width of the cell, but will not take up more than two. I was able to do some substring magic in oracle like:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT ID, SUBSTR(FIELD1, 1, 70) FROM....
UNION
SELECT ID, SUBSTR(FIELD1, 70) FROM ...
</code></pre>

<p>using sorting, I am able to get up to 4 rows of data per ID which I will be able to split the lookupset and get each value into the table.</p>

<p>My last problem, and hopefully someone can help with is that when I ge the substring, It can cut off words and the next row will start with the rest of the word.
Is there a way, possibly using a regex to make sure to keep words in tact, but also to ensure that the total length returned is &lt; some number of characters? I am happy to abandon any part of the approach i am currently taking if I am off track.</p>

<p>I'd like some suggestions on how to do this.</p>

<p>But what I was thinking was that every 3 days the third day backups are deleted. But one is kept. </p>

<p>This would mean that my backup total is 73.5gb after 3 days of backups. Then I want to keep that third day backup for 1 week. So on the 10th day it is deleted. So about 85gb of total data is backed up.</p>

<p>Ever hour for 2 days and then 1 hour from every day after that 8 times.</p>

<p>I was thinking the easiest way to do it would be move that 1 hour backup from the third day to a new folder and have a separate script for it that is run daily. However I am not sure how I would go about picking out one of them out from the others and how to delete the ones older than 2 days. </p>

<p>I would likely run these scripts as cronjobs and set them to daily.</p>

Any perspectives on using Ruby and Savon versus Java and Axis? </p>

<p>With Ruby/Savon, it seems that the best thing to do is to skip using the WSDL files and generate the requests based on examples from the Java/Axis program. I tried using the WSDL feature of Savon, but I could not get it to work with the many embedded types and namespaces in the very complex WSDLs.</p>

<p>Looking at the Java/Axis code, there's a huge amount of generated code that isolates the Java developer from knowing about the XML. Has anybody ever tried to replicate Axis in the Ruby world?</p>

<p>I'm looking for a solution to enumerate all applications installed on a (Mac) OS X system, i.e. all application bundles registered with <a href=""https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Carbon/Reference/LaunchServicesReference/Reference/reference.html"" rel=""nofollow"">LaunchServices</a>.</p>

<h1>Simple approach that did not work</h1>

<p>(Please note: <code>lsregister</code> can be found under <code>/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Support/lsregister</code>).</p>

<p>Currently I am using the output of <code>lsregister -dump | grep -E '^.*[ \\t]*path:[ \\t]+(\/.*)$' | grep -Eo '\/.*'</code>, which has a few problems:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>.app</code> bundles with newlines (<code>\n</code>, which is valid on UNIX) are not handled correctly (This issue would be fixable by writing a proper parser)</li>
<li><p><code>lsregister</code> doesn't handle correctly weird filename (e.g. containing the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-to-left_mark"" rel=""nofollow"">RTL mark</a>). <code>lsregister</code> just seems to ignore files with the RTL mark in their name. 
If you want to, you can create a file with RTL in its name by running the following command.</p>

<pre><code>python -c 'import shutil; shutil.copytree(u""/Applications/TextEdit.app"", u""/Applications/ThisIsAWeird\u202EApp.app"")'
</code></pre>

<p>After doing this, <code>lsregister -dump | grep ThisIsAWeird</code> will <em>not</em> reveal it. But when you right click on a text file and go to ""Open With"" you'll that LaunchServices and Finder still support that file.
<img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/c40Jq.png"" alt=""see yourself""></p></li>
</ul>

<p>Simply enumerating all files in <code>/Applications</code> and other directories does not work because LaunchServices is aware of application bundles in arbitrary folders and I also need these apps.</p>

<h1>Other approch that I didn't get to work</h1>

<p>Apparently, there's a private API function called <code>_LSFindApplications</code> which does exactly what I need to do but I can't get it to work and didn't find any inofficial documentation on the internet. (proof it exists: <code>nm /System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/LaunchServices  | grep __LSFindApplications$</code>)</p>

<p>I can imagine that caching avoids producing overhead for reading the file time after time. </p>

<p>Or should I store the doc.xm in a variable and  use that variable to query?  </p>

<p>In this case I will have to use some sort of library like xsle since I am using xslt1.  </p>

<p>Or is there any other solution?  </p>

<p>Note : Some parts of the XPath should be dynamic like : </p>

<pre><code>&lt;xsl:value-of select=""document('doc.xml')/root/*[name()=$lang]/foo3"" /&gt;
</code></pre>

"98","How can I find out if my GNU C library is thread-safe?","<p>I'm currently <a href=""http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/answers/35754-segmentation-faults-when-running-mex-files-in-parallel"" rel=""nofollow"">receiving weird segmentation violations when runnning a MATLAB MEX file in paralle</a>l. </p>

<p>After a lot of debugging, I'm 99% sure that the segmentation violation has nothing to do with the MEX file itself but with the fact that I'm running it in parallel.</p>

<p>One possible reason for the segmentation violations that was suggested is that the C library functions ""malloc"" and ""free"" may not be thread-safe. Is this really a possibility? And is there any way that I can make sure? </p>

<p>I compiled the MEX file using the ""GNU C 2.14.90 development"" C Library - so I guess I'm looking for a website where this is distributed / these types of questions are answered. </p>

"99","JSP link submitting data to struts form bean","<p>I am making a JSP page that links to a page where it will pull a list of data from the database depending on the user who is logged in. I am using a DataSourceRealm type authentication so I pull the username with a <code>request.geRemoteUser()</code> and want to submit that to my form when I click the link but I cannot figure out how to do that, my link code is:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;li&gt;&lt;html:link forward=""showEnrolled""&gt;View Enrolled Classes&lt;/html:link&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And my form just needs the username to run. Is there anyway I can get it to send the username along with the forward?</p>

<p>I am not sure whether the question is correct.Thank you.(I tried this idea: $f(x)=f(x+y-y)\ge f(x+y)+f(-y)\ge f(x)+f(y)+f(-y)\implies f(y)\leq -f(-y)$ but after that I seem to be hitting a roadblock.</p>

<p>Thank you in advance.</p>
